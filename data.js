    prompt2:"I want to learn to play acoustic guitar. I am a complete beginner — I have never played any string instrument before. I can dedicate approximately 3-5 hours per week to practice (about 30-45 minutes per day, 5-6 days a week). My goal is to play songs for fun — campfire songs, pop songs I can sing along to, and eventually some fingerpicking pieces.\n\nPlease create a comprehensive learning plan that includes:\n\n1. **Introduction to the Guitar**: Brief history of the acoustic guitar, how it produces sound, the difference between acoustic, classical, and electric guitars, parts of the guitar (headstock, tuners, nut, fretboard, frets, body, sound hole, bridge, saddle, strings), and what makes the guitar one of the most popular instruments in the world.\n\n2. **Managing Expectations**: What a complete beginner should realistically expect. Be honest about finger pain (calluses take 2-4 weeks), the frustration of chord changes, the \"ugly sound\" phase, and the typical timeline to play a full song. Explain that everyone goes through this and it gets dramatically better.\n\n3. **Understanding Commitment**: How 30 minutes of focused daily practice beats 3 hours on weekends. The difference between noodling and deliberate practice. How to build the habit: same time, same place, guitar always accessible. What makes guitar learners quit (usually around weeks 3-6) and how to push through.\n\n4. **Expected Results by Commitment Level**:\n\n| Hours/Week | After 1 Month | After 3 Months | After 6 Months | After 1 Year | After 2 Years |\n|------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|\n| 1-2 hrs | Basic open chords (Em, Am), simple strumming | 4-5 chords, 1-2 simple songs | 8+ chords, 3-5 songs, basic rhythm | Barre chords starting, 10+ songs | Confident rhythm player |\n| 3-5 hrs | Em, Am, G, C, D chords, basic strumming patterns | Smooth chord changes, 3-4 songs, basic fingerpicking | Full songs with singing, barre chord intro, basic music theory | Barre chords comfortable, fingerpicking patterns, 20+ songs | Intermediate player, some lead guitar |\n| 5-10 hrs | All basic open chords, 2-3 strumming patterns, first song | Fluid chord transitions, 6-8 songs, basic theory, simple fingerpicking | Barre chords, capo usage, 10+ songs, beginning improvisation | Lead guitar basics, multiple styles, performing for others | Advanced intermediate, complex fingerpicking, soloing |\n| 10+ hrs | Open and some barre chords, multiple strumming patterns, 2-3 songs | Confident chord playing, basic scales, 10+ songs, theory foundations | Intermediate level, improvisation, multiple genres, performing | Advanced techniques, music theory fluency, songwriting | Near-advanced player, complex pieces, confident performer |\n\n5. **Detailed Learning Plan** (Week-by-Week for 6 Months):\n\n**Month 1 — Foundations:**\n- Week 1: Guitar anatomy, proper holding position, tuning (use a clip-on tuner or app), right-hand strumming motion on open strings, finger placement basics\n- Week 2: First chords — Em and Am.

Plan your next 6 months. Monthly checkpoint: perform a 15-minute mini-concert (5 songs) for family or friends\n\n**Practice Session Structure** (for a 30-minute session):\n- 3 min: Warm-up (finger stretches, chromatic exercise)\n- 5 min: Technique drill (chord transitions, scale practice, or fingerpicking pattern)\n- 10 min: New material (learning a new song section, new chord, or new technique)\n- 10 min: Repertoire review (play through songs you know, focus on weak spots)\n- 2 min: Cool-down (play something you love and enjoy, free play)\n\n6. **Requirements to Get Started**:\n- **Guitar** (Budget ~$80-120): Yamaha FG800, Fender FA-15 — (Mid-range ~$200-400): Taylor Academy 10, Yamaha FG830 — (Quality ~$500+): Taylor 114ce, Martin D-15M\n- **Essential accessories**: Clip-on tuner ($10-15), Extra strings pack ($5-8), Guitar picks — variety pack of thicknesses ($3-5), Guitar strap ($8-15), Capo ($8-12)\n- **Helpful extras**: Guitar stand or wall hanger ($12-25), Metronome app (free), Finger exerciser/grip trainer ($8-12), Music stand ($15-30), Comfortable chair without arms\n- **Practice space**: Quiet room where you won't be interrupted, good lighting, a chair without armrests, your guitar on a stand (not in the case — visible guitar = more practice)\n- **Apps**: GuitarTuna (free tuner), Justin Guitar app (free lessons), Ultimate Guitar (chord charts), Songsterr (interactive tabs), Metronome Beats (free)\n\n7. **Personal Recommendations**:\n- Keep your guitar out of its case, on a stand, in the room where you spend the most time. If you see it, you'll pick it up\n- Practice at the same time every day — attach it to an existing habit (after morning coffee, after dinner)\n- Record yourself monthly. You won't notice daily progress, but monthly recordings show dramatic improvement\n- When your fingers hurt, practice for just 5 more minutes, then stop. Calluses build faster with consistent short exposure\n- Learn songs you actually love. Motivation beats method every time\n- Play along with recordings or backing tracks — it's more fun and trains your timing\n- Don't compare your Day 30 to someone else's Year 3. Compare to YOUR Day 1\n- Consider a teacher for at least the first month to avoid bad habits in posture and technique\n- Join r/guitar on Reddit or a local guitar group — community keeps you accountable\n- When you hit a plateau (everyone does around month 2-3), learn a completely different style of song to reignite excitement\n\n8. **Recommended Resources**:\n- **YouTube**: Justin Guitar (best free course), Marty Music, Andy Guitar\n- **Apps**: Yousician (interactive), Fender Play (structured courses), Justin Guitar app\n- **Books**: \"Hal Leonard Guitar Method\" (structured), \"Guitar Aerobics\" (daily exercises)\n- **Websites**: Ultimate-Guitar.com (tabs & chords), Songsterr.com (interactive tabs)\n- **Communities**: r/guitarlessons, r/beginnerguitar, local open mic nights\n\n9. **Additional Insights**:\n- Myth: \"You need natural talent.\" Reality: Guitar is 95% practice, 5% aptitude. Virtually anyone can learn\n- Myth: \"You need to learn to read sheet music first.\" Reality: Most guitarists use tabs and chord charts — learn theory gradually\n- Playing music reduces cortisol (stress hormone) and increases dopamine — it literally makes you happier\n- You only need 4 chords (G, Em, C, D) to play hundreds of popular songs\n- Learning guitar improves hand-eye coordination, memory, and even mathematical thinking\n- The best time to find jam partners: after month 3-4, when you can hold basic chord progressions\n\n10. **10 Fun Facts About the Guitar**:\n1. The guitar's ancestors date back over 4,000 years to ancient Babylon\n2. The world's largest playable guitar is 43 feet long — built by students in Texas\n3. Jimi Hendrix was left-handed but played a right-handed guitar flipped upside down — he restrung it so the low E was still on top\n4. The most expensive guitar ever sold was Kurt Cobain's \"MTV Unplugged\" Martin D-18E, for $6 million in 2020\n5. Nylon strings (classical guitar) are actually made from fluorocarbon or nylon, while \"steel strings\" are often bronze-wound\n6. The guitar is the most popular instrument in the world — an estimated 50 million people play it\n7. It takes about 100 hours of playing to build permanent calluses on your fingertips\n8. The frets on a guitar are placed using the 12th root of 2 (≈1.05946) — pure mathematics creates musical harmony\n9. Playing guitar uses both hemispheres of your brain simultaneously — few activities do this\n10. The word \"guitar\" comes from the Spanish \"guitarra,\" which came from the Greek \"kithara\" — an ancient stringed instrument\n\nFormat everything with clear headers, bullet points, and the commitment table.

    description:"Most parents think they listen. Most children say they don't. The gap is enormous — and it's not about hearing. You hear the words fine. The problem is what you DO with them. When your child says 'school was boring,' your instinct is to fix ('Did you try talking to the teacher?'), dismiss ('At least you get to go to school'), or redirect ('Well, what about the good parts?'). Every one of these responses, however well-intentioned, sends the same message: 'What you feel is not valid as-is. Let me correct it.' True listening — what psychologists call attunement — means receiving your child's words, reflecting them back, and sitting with the feeling without needing to change it. It is, without exaggeration, the single most important skill in parenting. And it is the hardest. Because listening means tolerating your own discomfort when your child is unhappy, and not rushing to make it (and your own anxiety) go away.",

In reality, receiving an unexpected message from someone you've lost touch with almost always feels good — it means someone thought of you. The challenge isn't whether they'll appreciate it. It's finding the right words — a message that acknowledges the time gap without dwelling on it, that's warm without being over-the-top, that opens a door without pressuring them to walk through it. AI is remarkably good at helping you strike this tone.",
    steps:["Think about who you want to reconnect with and why","Consider what you know about their life now (if anything)","Decide on the medium (text, email, social media DM, handwritten letter)","Get a draft message that sounds like YOU, not a robot"],
    prompt:"I want to reconnect with someone I've lost touch with and I need help writing the perfect message.\n\nWho: [RELATIONSHIP — e.g., 'my college roommate', 'a cousin I was close to growing up', 'a former coworker I really liked', 'my childhood best friend', 'an old mentor', 'a friend from my old neighborhood', 'an ex I'm on okay terms with but we drifted apart'].\n\nTime since last contact: [TIME — e.g., '2 years', '5 years', 'over 10 years', 'we had a falling out 3 years ago and haven't spoken since'].\n\nWhat prompted this: [TRIGGER — e.g., 'I saw their post on social media', 'something reminded me of them', 'I heard they went through something difficult', 'I'm going through a life change and realized I miss them', 'no specific reason — just been thinking about them', 'I'm visiting their city soon'].\n\nWhat I know about their life now: [CONTEXT — e.g., 'they got married and have kids', 'they moved to another country', 'I don't know much — we're not connected on social media', 'they seem to be doing well professionally', 'I heard they lost a parent recently'].\n\nMedium: [CHANNEL — e.g., 'text message', 'Instagram DM', 'email', 'WhatsApp', 'Facebook message', 'handwritten letter'].\n\nMy style: [TONE — e.g., 'casual and lighthearted', 'warm and sincere', 'brief and low-pressure', 'I tend to use humor', 'I'm a pretty formal communicator'].\n\nPlease help me write a message that:\n1. Acknowledges the time gap naturally without over-apologizing or making it a big deal\n2. Sounds genuinely like me, not like a template or a generic 'Hey stranger!' message\n3. References something specific from our shared history (I'll fill in details)\n4. Opens the door for reconnection without creating pressure to respond immediately\n5. Is appropriate for the medium (short for text/DM, can be longer for email/letter)\n6. Avoids common pitfalls: being too formal, too casual, too apologetic, or too needy\n7. If there was a falling out or awkward ending, addresses it with grace without dwelling on it",
    promptTip:"The best reconnection messages have three ingredients: (1) a specific shared memory that shows you actually think about them ('Remember when we...'), (2) genuine curiosity about their life now ('I'd love to hear what you've been up to'), and (3) a low-pressure close ('No pressure to respond — just wanted you to know I was thinking of you'). Keep it shorter than you think it should be. A 3-4 sentence text hits harder than a long email. And don't overthink the timing — there's no perfect moment. Send it now.",

  {id:160, title:"Create Your Social Media Bio", subtitle:"Craft the perfect bio for any platform — concise, memorable, and authentically you", category:"social",
    description:"Your social media bio is the most underestimated piece of writing you'll ever publish. It's read more often than anything else you post. It's the first impression for every new profile visitor, potential follower, employer, client, collaborator, or date who checks you out. And most people's bios are terrible — either a generic list of roles ('Mom | Wife | Coffee Lover | Dog Person'), a cringe-worthy inspirational quote, or nothing at all. A great bio does three things in very few characters: it tells people who you are, what you care about, and gives them a reason to follow or connect. Each platform has its own culture, character limits, and expectations — what works on LinkedIn would be bizarre on TikTok, and what kills on Twitter/X would fall flat on Instagram. AI can help you craft platform-specific bios that are sharp, memorable, and sound like the version of you that you actually want to present to the world — not the version that stares at a blinking cursor for 20 minutes and settles for 'Just living life.'",
    steps:["Choose which platform(s) you want bios for","Think about how you want to be perceived on each platform","Gather your key details (profession, interests, personality traits, goals)","Generate and refine bios that feel authentically you"],
    prompt:"I need help creating social media bios that are sharp, memorable, and actually represent who I am.\n\nPlatform(s): [PLATFORMS — e.g., 'LinkedIn', 'Instagram', 'X/Twitter', 'TikTok', 'all of the above', 'YouTube', 'Threads', 'personal website'].\n\nAbout me: [DETAILS — e.g., 'I'm a graphic designer who also makes music on the side', 'I'm a high school teacher who coaches basketball', 'I'm a startup founder in the AI space', 'I'm a stay-at-home parent who blogs about sustainable living', 'I'm a recent grad trying to break into marketing'].\n\nWhat I want to convey: [VIBE — e.g., 'professional but approachable', 'creative and a bit irreverent', 'authoritative and expert', 'warm and relatable', 'funny and memorable', 'minimalist and mysterious'].\n\nMy personality: [TRAITS — e.g., 'dry sense of humor', 'enthusiastic and energetic', 'thoughtful and introspective', 'sarcastic but kind', 'straightforward and no-nonsense'].\n\nKey things to include: [MUST-HAVES — e.g., 'my job title', 'my location', 'a specific achievement', 'a call to action (link to my work)', 'my niche or area of expertise', 'something personal that makes me human'].\n\nThings to avoid: [AVOID — e.g., 'cliché phrases like \"living my best life\"', 'too many emojis', 'anything too corporate', 'listing every role I play', 'inspirational quotes'].\n\nPlease create:\n1. 3 bio options per platform, ranging from safe/professional to bold/creative\n2. Each bio should respect the platform's character limits (LinkedIn: 220 chars headline, 2600 chars About; Instagram: 150 chars; X/Twitter: 160 chars; TikTok: 80 chars)\n3. Platform-appropriate tone and conventions (LinkedIn is professional, TikTok is casual, X is witty, Instagram is visual/lifestyle-oriented)\n4. A brief note explaining what makes each option work and who it would appeal to\n5. Suggestions for emojis, line breaks, or formatting tricks specific to each platform",
    promptTip:"The best bios break one rule: they sacrifice completeness for memorability. You don't need to list everything you are — you need to say ONE thing that sticks. The LinkedIn bio that says 'I help small businesses stop wasting money on ads that don't work' is infinitely better than 'Marketing Professional | MBA | 10+ Years Experience | Passionate About Growth.' For Instagram and TikTok, line breaks and strategic emoji placement matter more than the words themselves. Test your bio by reading it aloud — if it sounds like a human talking, it's good. If it sounds like a resume, rewrite it.",

  // ===== JOB HUNTING (161-163) =====
  {id:161, title:"Create a Personal Introduction Letter", subtitle:"Craft a tailored introduction letter that connects your skills to the company and role", category:"jobs",
    description:"A great introduction letter does more than list your qualifications — it tells a story about why YOU are the right person for THIS role at THIS company. The problem? Most people write generic letters that could apply to any job, or they spend hours agonizing over every sentence only to produce something stiff and forgettable. AI changes this equation dramatically. It can research the company's mission, recent news, and culture, then help you craft a letter that genuinely connects your specific experience and skills to what the company actually needs. The result reads like you spent days researching and writing — because the AI did the heavy lifting while you provided the authentic details only you know. The key is giving the AI enough context about both you and the target company so it can make genuine connections, not generic ones.",
    steps:["Gather information about the target company and position","List your relevant skills, experience, and what motivates you about this role","Provide this context to the AI and let it craft the initial draft","Review and personalize — add specific anecdotes and your authentic voice"],
    prompt:"I need help writing a compelling personal introduction letter for a job application.\n\nTarget company: [COMPANY NAME — e.g., 'Google', 'a local marketing agency called BrightSpark', 'a startup in the fintech space'].\n\nPosition: [JOB TITLE — e.g., 'Senior Software Engineer', 'Marketing Manager', 'Entry-level Data Analyst'].\n\nJob posting key requirements: [KEY REQUIREMENTS — paste the main requirements from the job listing, or summarize them: e.g., '5+ years experience in Python, team leadership, experience with cloud infrastructure'].\n\nAbout me:\n- Current role/situation: [CURRENT STATUS — e.g., 'Software developer with 4 years experience at a mid-size company', 'Recent graduate with internship experience', 'Career changer from teaching to tech']\n- Relevant skills: [SKILLS — e.g., 'Python, AWS, team lead for 2 projects', 'data analysis, Excel, SQL, Tableau']\n- Key achievements: [ACHIEVEMENTS — e.g., 'Led migration that reduced costs by 30%', 'Built dashboard used by 50+ stakeholders']\n- Why this company: [MOTIVATION — e.g., 'I admire their open-source contributions', 'Their mission to democratize education resonates with my background', 'I want to work at a smaller company where I can have more impact']\n- Why this role: [MOTIVATION — e.g., 'It combines my technical skills with my desire to lead a team', 'It is a perfect match for my data skills and domain knowledge in healthcare']\n\nTone: [TONE — e.g., 'professional but warm', 'confident and enthusiastic', 'formal', 'conversational and genuine'].\n\nPlease:\n1. Research what you know about this company (mission, values, recent developments) and weave relevant connections into the letter\n2. Write a compelling opening that immediately shows I've done my homework — no generic 'I am writing to apply for...'\n3. Connect my specific skills and achievements to their stated requirements with concrete examples\n4. Show genuine enthusiasm for the company and role without being sycophantic\n5. End with a confident but not presumptuous closing\n6. Keep it to one page (roughly 300-400 words)\n7. Provide 2 versions: one more formal, one more conversational, so I can choose which fits the company culture better",
    promptTip:"The single biggest mistake in introduction letters is being generic. Never say 'I am passionate about technology' — instead say 'I spent my weekends building a tool that automates meal planning because I believe software should solve real daily problems.' Specific beats impressive every time. Also, research the company beyond their About page: check their blog, recent press releases, and the LinkedIn profiles of people on the team you'd join. Mentioning something specific ('I noticed your team recently shipped X — that approach to Y is exactly the kind of work I want to do') instantly separates you from 95% of applicants.",

  {id:162, title:"Create a Job Hunting Plan", subtitle:"Build a structured, actionable plan with goals, milestones, and a calendar to organize your job search", category:"jobs",
    description:"Job hunting without a plan is like navigating without a map — you end up applying randomly, losing track of where you applied, missing follow-up deadlines, and burning out from the lack of structure. A good job hunting plan transforms a stressful, chaotic process into a manageable project with clear phases, weekly goals, and measurable milestones. AI can help you build a comprehensive plan tailored to your situation — whether you're a fresh graduate entering the market for the first time, a professional looking to switch industries, or someone re-entering the workforce after a gap. The plan covers everything: self-assessment, target company research, resume and portfolio preparation, networking strategy, application tracking, interview preparation, and negotiation. You can choose to get your plan as an editable document (Word, Excel, CSV) or a printable formatted version (HTML, PDF) — whatever works best for your workflow.",
    steps:["Assess your current situation: experience level, target industry, timeline, constraints","Tell the AI your preferences for format and level of detail","Review the generated plan and customize the milestones to your reality","Set up weekly check-ins with yourself to track progress against the plan"],
    prompt:"I need help creating a comprehensive, structured job hunting plan.\n\nAbout my situation:\n- Current status: [STATUS — e.g., 'employed but looking to switch', 'recently laid off', 'fresh graduate', 'returning after a career break of 2 years', 'freelancer wanting to go full-time']\n- Target role(s): [ROLES — e.g., 'Product Manager at a tech company', 'any marketing role', 'Data Scientist or ML Engineer', 'I am not sure yet — I need help figuring this out']\n- Target industry: [INDUSTRY — e.g., 'tech', 'healthcare', 'finance', 'open to anything', 'specifically startups']\n- Experience level: [LEVEL — e.g., 'entry-level', 'mid-career (5-7 years)', 'senior (10+ years)', 'executive']\n- Timeline: [TIMELINE — e.g., 'I want a new job within 3 months', 'no rush — exploring over the next 6 months', 'urgent — I need income within 4 weeks']\n- Geographic constraints: [LOCATION — e.g., 'remote only', 'willing to relocate anywhere', 'must stay in New York area', 'open to hybrid in London']\n- Key challenges: [CHALLENGES — e.g., 'I have gaps in my resume', 'I am switching industries with no direct experience', 'I am not getting callbacks', 'I do not know how to network', 'I freeze in interviews']\n\nWhat I want in the plan:\n1. A phased approach (preparation → active search → interviewing → negotiation/closing)\n2. Weekly goals and specific action items for each phase\n3. A milestone tracker so I can see progress\n4. Networking strategy (who to reach out to, what to say, how to follow up)\n5. Application tracking system (companies, dates, status, contacts, next steps)\n6. Interview preparation checklist\n7. Salary research and negotiation preparation\n8. Self-care and motivation tips to avoid burnout during the search\n\nOutput format: [FORMAT — choose one or more: 'editable Word document structure', 'Excel/CSV spreadsheet for tracking', 'HTML page I can print or save as PDF', 'simple markdown I can paste into Notion/Obsidian', 'a detailed text plan I can reference daily'].\n\nPlease make the plan realistic and actionable — not a generic checklist, but something tailored to my specific situation with concrete next steps I can start today.",
    promptTip:"The most effective job hunters treat their search like a project with KPIs. Track metrics like: applications sent per week, response rate, interviews scheduled, networking conversations had. If your response rate is below 10%, your resume or targeting needs work — not more volume. Block dedicated time on your calendar for job hunting (e.g., 9-12 daily if unemployed, 1 hour every evening if employed). And don't neglect the 'hidden job market' — up to 70% of jobs are filled through networking before they're ever posted publicly. Your plan should allocate at least 30% of your effort to networking, not just applications.",

Instead of juggling spreadsheets, sticky notes, and browser bookmarks, ask AI to generate a complete, self-contained interactive HTML/CSS/JS page that serves as your personal job hunting command center. The generated page includes a company tracker (with fields for company name, position, contact person, email, application date, status, and notes), an interview preparation section (common questions, company research notes, your STAR stories), a progress dashboard with visual indicators, and a calendar view of upcoming deadlines and follow-ups. The killer feature: save and load your data as a .cemijob file (a JSON or XML file with a custom extension) so your progress persists across sessions. Open the HTML file in any browser, load your .cemijob file, update your progress, and save it again. No server needed, no account required, no subscription — just a single HTML file and your data file. It's your entire job search in two files you can carry on a USB stick.",

If you want to customize the design or add features, paste the entire HTML back to the AI with your change requests — since it's a single file, AI can modify it easily.
