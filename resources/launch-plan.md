### Article 1: Origin Story (Week 1, Monday)

**Title:** How a School Talk Became a Guide to 163 Things You Can Do with AI

When I was invited to speak about AI to students at the Lycee Francais de Saint Domingue — my son's school — I wanted to do more than give a lecture. I wanted to show them.

So I built a demo site. A few practical things you can do with AI, with real prompts they could copy and try themselves.

That demo became 10 things. Then 50. Then 100. Then I realized: the students got it immediately, but their parents had questions too. My business clients were curious. Colleagues wanted a reference they could share.

What started as a 30-minute talk became **100.cemi.ai** — a living, interactive guide to 163+ practical things you can do with AI, available in 8 languages, with ready-to-use prompts for every single one.

Here's what I learned building it:

**1. AI is not about doing the same thing faster.**
The real benefit isn't speed — it's capability. It's doing things you simply could not do before. I created a jazz band with full albums in 3 hours. A video game in 15 minutes. 35 commercial videos in 35 days. None of that was possible before AI.

**2. People don't need theory — they need a starting point.**
Every item on the site has step-by-step instructions and a prompt you can copy right now. No setup, no prerequisites, no jargon. Try "Summarize Any Article" — it takes 2 minutes.

**3. The best AI guide is community-driven.**
I don't have all the answers. That's why the site has a suggestion system — anyone can submit new ideas, and the community votes on what matters. It's a living catalog, not a static list.

**4. Language shouldn't be a barrier.**
The full site is available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Japanese, and Chinese. AI is for everyone.

If you've been wondering where to start with AI — or how to help your team, your students, or your family get started — this is the resource I wish I'd had.

Explore it: https://100.cemi.ai

And if you think something's missing, submit a suggestion directly on the site. This guide grows with its community.

### Article 2: AI for Your Team (Week 2, Wednesday)

**Title:** 10 Ways Your Team Can Start Using AI This Week (No Training Required)

You don't need an AI strategy document. You don't need a vendor demo. You don't need a committee.

You need 10 minutes and a browser.

Here are 10 things anyone on your team can try today, with zero setup:

1. **Summarize meeting notes** — Paste your notes, get action items in bullet points
2. **Draft client emails** — Give context, get a professional draft in seconds
3. **Analyze survey responses** — Drop in free-text answers, get categorized themes
4. **Create a presentation outline** — Topic in, structured deck outline out
5. **Proofread and improve reports** — Better than spell-check, catches tone and clarity issues
6. **Generate social media posts** — One piece of content becomes 5 platform-specific posts
7. **Build a project timeline** — Describe the project, get a realistic Gantt-style breakdown
8. **Compare vendor proposals** — Paste two proposals, get a structured pros/cons analysis
9. **Create training materials** — Turn any process into step-by-step documentation
10. **Brainstorm solutions** — Describe a problem, get 10 approaches you hadn't considered

Every single one of these has a ready-to-copy prompt at https://100.cemi.ai — no account needed, no paywall, no fluff.

The question isn't whether AI is useful for your team. It's which of these 163 use cases you'll try first.

*Which one would save you the most time? Share in the comments — I'll reply with the specific prompt.*

### Post: "Stop Asking the Wrong Question" (Week 1, Wednesday)

Stop asking "What can AI do instead of me?"

Start asking "What can I do WITH AI that I never could before?"

I created a jazz band — 4 albums, 7 unique styles — in 3 hours.
I built a video game with students in 15 minutes.
I produced 35 commercial videos in 35 days.

None of this replaces anyone. All of it was impossible before.

163 practical examples of what's possible: https://100.cemi.ai

What would YOU create if the barrier wasn't skill — just imagination?

#AI #Innovation #CEMIAI

### Post: Showcase Highlight (Week 1, Friday)

In November, I needed to produce video content for a client.

Traditional approach: hire a production team, scout locations, schedule shoots, edit for weeks. Budget: substantial. Timeline: months.

What actually happened: I produced 35 videos in 35 days using AI tools. Professional quality. On brand. On time.

That project is one of 16 real-world showcases on https://100.cemi.ai — proof that AI isn't theoretical. It's production-ready.

Other showcases include:
- A complete jazz record label with 7 artists (built in a weekend)
- An educational video game (built in an afternoon)
- Interactive study materials for students

Every showcase includes the approach and tools used. See them all at https://100.cemi.ai/showcase.html

### Post: Job Hunting with AI (Week 4, Wednesday)

Job hunting is exhausting. AI won't get you hired — but it will make every step sharper.

3 things you can do right now:

1. **Personal Introduction Letter** — Not a generic cover letter. A strategic introduction tailored to each opportunity, highlighting YOUR specific value.

2. **Job Hunting Plan** — AI analyzes your background and target roles, then builds a structured action plan with timeline, networking strategy, and skills gaps to close.

3. **Advanced Job Hunting Planner** — An interactive tool that generates a comprehensive plan you can save, revisit, and adjust as your search evolves.

All three have ready-to-use prompts at https://100.cemi.ai (filter by "Job Hunting").

And if you have a job hunting tip that's worked for you — submit it on the site. We're building this guide together.

### Article 3: Lessons from Curating 163 AI Use Cases (Week 3, Monday)

**Title:** What I Learned Curating 163 Practical AI Use Cases

After months of building https://100.cemi.ai, here are the patterns I didn't expect:

**1. The "boring" use cases are the most valuable.**
Summarizing articles. Proofreading emails. Creating meeting agendas. Not glamorous. But these save 30+ minutes daily for anyone who tries them. The Quick Wins section exists because of this — 8 things you can do in under 5 minutes that genuinely change your workflow.

**2. Creative applications surprised people the most.**
When I show someone they can compose original music, create a video game, or generate artwork — with zero prior experience — something shifts. That's the moment they stop seeing AI as a tool and start seeing it as a capability multiplier.

**3. "What NOT to do" matters as much as "what to do."**
We added a dedicated Don'ts section because the mistakes are just as important. Don't blindly trust AI output. Don't submit AI work without review. Don't use it to replace critical thinking. Responsible use isn't a footnote — it's half the guide.

**4. Every language reveals different needs.**
Translating the site into 8 languages wasn't just a language task — it was a perspective task. Different cultures prioritize different use cases. The Japanese version gets different engagement patterns than the Spanish one. AI is universal, but context is local.

**5. The community knows more than the curator.**
The suggestion system was the best feature I added. People submit use cases I never considered. The guide grows smarter every week because it's not my list anymore — it's ours.

### Thread: 10 Things You Didn't Know AI Could Do (Week 2, Monday)

**Tweet 1:**
10 things you probably didn't know you could do with AI today:

(No coding. No special tools. Just a browser.)

A thread:

**Tweet 2:**
1. BUILD A PLAYABLE VIDEO GAME

Describe the game you want. AI generates a fully functional HTML game you can play in your browser.

I built a dungeon crawler, a frogger clone, and a soccer game — each from a single prompt.

**Tweet 3:**
2. COMPOSE A FULL ALBUM

Not a melody. A full album. Multiple tracks, different styles, with vocals if you want.

I created a 7-artist record label in a weekend: https://maimusic.org

**Tweet 4:**
3. DESIGN YOUR DREAM ROOM

Take a photo of your room. Tell AI what style you want. Get a photorealistic redesign.

Try different styles in minutes — mid-century modern, Japanese minimalist, industrial loft.

**Tweet 5:**
4. CREATE SPEAKING AVATARS

Upload a photo. Type what you want it to say. Get a realistic video of that person speaking.

Presentations, tutorials, social content — without being on camera.

**Tweet 6:**
5. RUN AI ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER

No internet. No subscription. No data sent anywhere.

Local AI models run entirely on your machine. Private, free, and surprisingly capable.

**Tweet 7:**
6. ANIMATE ANY PHOTO

A still photo becomes a 3-5 second video. People blink and smile. Landscapes come alive. Pets move.

It's borderline magic.

**Tweet 8:**
7. BUILD A PERSONAL BRAND STRATEGY

AI analyzes your background, goals, and audience — then creates a complete personal branding strategy with content pillars, posting schedule, and messaging framework.

**Tweet 9:**
8. CREATE INTERACTIVE STUDY MATERIALS

Not flashcards (though it does those too). Interactive quizzes, visual summaries, spaced-repetition plans, and custom practice problems — tailored to any subject.

**Tweet 10:**
9. GENERATE VISUAL INFOGRAPHICS

Describe your data or topic. AI creates a complete infographic — layout, colors, icons, and copy.

No design skills needed.

**Tweet 11:**
10. PLAN A FULL TRIP

Itinerary, budget, restaurant recommendations, local tips, packing list — all customized to your travel style and preferences.

Every single one of these has a prompt you can copy and use right now.

All 163 ideas: https://100.cemi.ai

### Thread: The Don'ts (Week 3, Monday)

**Tweet 1:**
Everyone talks about what AI CAN do.

Let's talk about what it SHOULDN'T do.

100.cemi.ai has a full "Don'ts" section. Here are the highlights:

**Tweet 2:**
DON'T submit AI output without reading it.

AI hallucinates. It invents citations. It states wrong things confidently.

You are the editor. Always.

**Tweet 3:**
DON'T use AI for final decisions on important matters.

Medical diagnosis. Legal advice. Financial planning.

AI can help you RESEARCH. The decision is yours.

**Tweet 4:**
DON'T share personal/sensitive information in prompts.

Your prompts may be stored, reviewed, or used for training.

Never paste passwords, private data, or confidential business info.

**Tweet 5:**
DON'T assume AI output is original.

It can reproduce copyrighted text, replicate art styles, or generate content that closely mirrors existing work.

Check before you publish.

**Tweet 6:**
DON'T use AI to replace learning.

Getting AI to write your essay isn't learning. Getting AI to HELP you understand the topic, outline your argument, and improve your draft — that's learning.

The difference matters.

**Tweet 7:**
The full Don'ts list (with explanations) is at https://100.cemi.ai

Because using AI well means knowing when NOT to.

### Post 1: Origin Story (Week 1, Tuesday)

A few months ago, I was invited to give a talk about AI to students at the Lycee Francais de Saint Domingue — my son's school.

I didn't want to just show slides. I wanted them to TRY things. So I built a small demo website with practical AI activities they could do themselves.

The students loved it. Then their parents asked for the link. Then colleagues. Then clients.

That little demo is now https://100.cemi.ai — a free guide to 163+ things you can do with AI, available in 8 languages, with ready-to-use prompts for everything.

It covers writing, learning, art, music, video, coding, business, science, family activities, job hunting... even things you should NOT do with AI.

It's also community-driven — anyone can submit new ideas using the "+" button on any page.

If you've been curious about AI but didn't know where to start, this is the starting point I wish I'd had. Take a look, try something, and let me know what you think.

And if you think someone in your life would benefit from this — a student, a colleague, a parent — please share it with them.

https://100.cemi.ai

### Post 2: Family/Education Angle (Week 2, Tuesday)

Parents: looking for something productive your kids can do with AI? (That isn't just chatting with ChatGPT for homework answers?)

100.cemi.ai has a whole Family category with activities you can do together:
- Create a personalized bedtime story
- Build a trivia game night
- Design a family comic strip
- Plan a scavenger hunt
- Make study flashcards fun

Plus a section on what NOT to do with AI — because teaching responsible use matters just as much.

Every activity has step-by-step instructions and a prompt you can copy-paste. No tech skills needed.

The site started as a school talk for students — it's designed for families first.

Try one this weekend and tell me how it goes: https://100.cemi.ai

## Standalone Article: The Origin Story

**Title:** How an Invitation to a School Talk Became a 163-Item Interactive AI Guide

**Target:** Personal blog, Medium, or LinkedIn article (for Week 4 or as a standalone piece)

---

It started with an email.

The Lycee Francais de Saint Domingue — my son's school — invited me to give a talk about Artificial Intelligence to their students. Not a technical deep-dive. Something practical. Something a teenager could walk away from and actually use.

I said yes immediately. But then I sat with the question: how do you make AI tangible for students who've heard the hype but haven't felt the possibility?

Slides wouldn't cut it. A lecture about neural networks would lose them in minutes. I needed them to DO something.

**The Demo**

So I built a website. Nothing fancy — just a clean page with 10 things you could do with AI right now, each with a prompt you could copy, paste, and try. Write a poem. Summarize an article. Create a study plan. Simple, immediate, no prerequisites.

During the talk, I watched it happen. Students pulled out their phones. They copied prompts. They showed each other results. A kid composed a song. Another one generated artwork. Someone built flashcards for their exam next week.

The energy in the room shifted from "this is a school presentation" to "wait, I can actually DO this?"

**The Expansion**

After the talk, parents approached me. "Can we have the link?" Then colleagues. "This is exactly what my team needs." Then clients. "Do you have something like this for business use cases?"

10 items became 50. 50 became 100. I added categories: Writing, Learning, Art, Music, Video, Productivity, Coding, Business, Science, Fun. I added a Showcase section with real projects — the jazz band I created in 3 hours, the video game students built in 15 minutes, the 35 commercial videos produced in 35 days.

Then I realized: if this is useful in English and French, why not Spanish? Portuguese? My team and I translated the entire site. Then German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese. Eight languages, every prompt adapted, every tool recommendation localized.

**The Philosophy**

Somewhere around item 80, I crystallized the principle that had been driving the project all along:

*AI is not about doing the same faster and easier. It is about doing MORE and BETTER than before. And about learning to do new things and improve ourselves.*

This became the site's mantra. It's the answer to the fear. AI doesn't replace you — it multiplies what you're capable of. I couldn't compose music before AI. I couldn't build video games. I couldn't produce 35 videos in 35 days. Now I can. Not because AI did it for me, but because AI gave me a capability I didn't have.

**The Community**

The most important feature I added wasn't a category or a showcase — it was the suggestion button. A small "+" icon on every page where anyone can submit new ideas, tips, tool recommendations, or questions.

Because 163 items curated by one person is useful. 163 items grown by a community is transformative.

**What I Learned**

1. **Start with doing, not explaining.** The students didn't need to understand how AI works. They needed to see what it could do FOR THEM. The theory became interesting AFTER the experience.

2. **The "boring" use cases change lives.** Summarizing articles and proofreading emails aren't exciting demos. But they save 30 minutes a day. Every day. That adds up to something profound.

3. **Creativity is the killer app.** When someone who's "not creative" composes a song or designs artwork for the first time, the shift is visible. AI democratizes creative expression in a way nothing else has.

4. **Responsible use isn't a footnote.** The Don'ts section gets as much engagement as the Do's. People WANT to know the boundaries. They want to use AI well, not just use it.

5. **Language is a bigger barrier than technology.** Making the site available in 8 languages didn't just translate content — it opened doors. The same guide that helps a student in Paris helps a professional in Tokyo.

**Where It's Going**

The site is at https://100.cemi.ai. It's free, it's growing, and it's open to everyone.

If something's missing, submit it. If something helped you, share it. If you tried something and it didn't work, tell me — that's just as valuable.

What started as a school talk became something I didn't plan: a living, breathing guide that belongs as much to its community as it does to me.

And it all started because a school asked me to give a talk, and I decided to show instead of tell.
