## 1. Vertical Flyer (Stories / Print Poster — 9:16)

```
Design a sleek, modern vertical flyer (9:16 aspect ratio) for a professional AI learning program. The flyer should look like a premium tech-education brand — clean, confident, and aspirational. No stock-photo clichés or generic AI imagery.

LAYOUT (top to bottom):

TOP BAND: A warm sand-toned (#E0CBA8) header strip with the logo text "CEMI.AI" in small uppercase dark red (#a70000) letters, top-left corner. Top-right corner: "100.cemi.ai/program" in small cobalt blue (#2F4F6F) text.

HERO AREA (top 40%): A rich, deep-navy-to-dark-charcoal gradient background. In the center, an elegant abstract illustration: a luminous golden (#D9A441) neural-network constellation forming the silhouette of a human head in profile, with branching nodes flowing outward and transforming into icons representing different professional domains — a briefcase, a chart, a pen, a lightbulb, a code bracket, a presentation screen. The nodes glow softly in dark red, gold, cobalt blue, and earth green. Subtle floating translucent orbs in the background.

MAIN HEADLINE (overlaid on the hero, bottom portion): Large bold white text: "AI for Professionals" — and directly below in ochre gold (#D9A441): "The Learning Program That Adapts to You"

CONTENT AREA (middle 45%): Clean white or very light sand (#f5f0eb) background. Three horizontal cards stacked vertically, each with a colored left-edge accent and an icon:
- Dark red (#a70000) accent — target icon — "Hyper-Personalized" — "Built around your role, industry, and goals"
- Ochre gold (#D9A441) accent — wrench icon — "Hands-On Practical" — "Learn by doing with real AI tools"
- Cobalt blue (#2F4F6F) accent — brain icon — "Smoother Methodology" — "Six cognitive steps from exploration to mastery"

Below the cards, a thin dividing line, then a compact grid showing: "4 Core Modules · 5 Electives · 6 Specializations" in small elegant type. Below that: "Formats from 1 hour to 40 hours · Self-paced, Coached, or In-Person"

BOTTOM CTA BAND: A bold dark red (#a70000) full-width band at the bottom. Large white text: "Request Your Program" — and below it, smaller: "100.cemi.ai/contact" in sand-colored text. Earth green (#4B775A) subtle accent line above the band.

STYLE: Premium editorial design. Clean typography (geometric sans-serif like Inter or Montserrat). Generous whitespace. No gradients on text. No cheesy AI robots or glowing brains — sophisticated and professional. The overall feel should be: "This is a serious program for serious professionals."

## 2. Horizontal Flyer (Social Media / Web Banner — 16:9)

```
Design a wide horizontal flyer (16:9 aspect ratio) for a professional AI learning program. The design should feel like a premium course landing page hero — modern, clean, and compelling. No generic AI stock imagery.

LAYOUT (left to right, two-column approach):

LEFT HALF — VISUAL:
A rich dark background (deep navy #0a0a1a fading to charcoal). An elegant abstract illustration: a diverse group of three professionals (different ages, genders, ethnicities) seen from mid-chest up, each looking forward with confidence. They are rendered in a stylized editorial illustration style — not photorealistic, but warm and human. Around and between them, flowing ribbons of light in dark red (#a70000), ochre gold (#D9A441), cobalt blue (#2F4F6F), and earth green (#4B775A) weave and connect, forming abstract symbols: a neural network, a pen, a bar chart, a lightbulb, a graduation cap. Soft glowing orbs of warm gold and red float in the background. The overall mood: empowerment, competence, possibility.

RIGHT HALF — CONTENT (light background, sand-white #f5f0eb):
Top: "CEMI.AI" in small uppercase dark red, with "100.cemi.ai" below it in tiny cobalt blue.

Main headline in large, bold dark text (#2d2a35): "AI for Professionals"
Subheadline in ochre gold (#D9A441): "Hyper-Personalized · Hands-On · Your Pace"

Below, three compact rows with colored dot indicators:
🔴 "4 Core Modules — Foundations, Prompting, Workflows, Ethics"
🟡 "5 Electives — Writing, Research, Presentations, Data, Learning"
🔵 "6 Specializations — Leadership, Marketing, HR, Finance, Education, Creative"

Below, a subtle line, then: "From 1-hour briefs to 40-hour immersions" in small text.

Bottom-right: A prominent dark red (#a70000) rounded button shape with white text: "Request Your Program" — and below it "100.cemi.ai/contact" in small cobalt blue.

Bottom-left of the right half: "Take the free AI Readiness Assessment → 100.cemi.ai/ai-readiness" in earth green (#4B775A) small text.

STYLE: Split-composition with dark visual left and light content right. The boundary between the two halves should be a soft diagonal or organic curve, not a hard vertical line — the dark side bleeds slightly into the light side with a gradient fade. Typography is clean, modern, and hierarchical (geometric sans-serif). No cluttered text. Generous padding. The feel should be sophisticated and inviting — a program you'd be proud to attend.

## Usage Notes

- Both prompts are optimized for **Gemini with Imagen 3** (or Gemini 2.0 Flash with image generation).
- If Gemini struggles with text rendering, regenerate or simplify the text elements and add them in post-production (Canva, Figma).
- The vertical format works for Instagram/LinkedIn Stories, print posters, and event handouts.
- The horizontal format works for LinkedIn posts, Twitter/X cards, website banners, and email headers.
- Both use the CEMI.AI brand palette consistently and avoid generic "AI brain" or "robot hand" clichés.
