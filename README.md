# 100 Things You Can Do with AI

A comprehensive, interactive website created for a talk at **Lycee Francais de Saint Domingue**, presented by [CEMI.AI](https://cemi.ai).

**Live site:** [https://100.cemi.ai](https://100.cemi.ai)

## About

This project showcases 100 practical things you can do with AI, organized into 10 categories. Each item includes step-by-step guides, ready-to-use prompts, recommended tools, and resource links. The site is designed for teenager students to explore, learn, and start creating with AI.

### Our Mantra

> AI is not about doing the same faster and easier -- it is about doing MORE and BETTER than before. And about learning to do new things and improve ourselves.

## Features

- **100 AI use cases** across 10 categories: Writing, Learning, Art, Music, Video, Productivity, Coding, Business, Science, and Personal
- **Ready-to-copy prompts** with one-click copy for each use case
- **Step-by-step guides** for every item
- **Showcase section** with real AI projects by Carlos Miranda Levy
- **Content & Format guide** covering Markdown and HTML as foundational AI skills
- **Search and filter** by category or keywords
- **Progress tracker** showing how many items you've explored
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Dark theme** with vibrant gradient accents

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks, no build step)
- Google Fonts: Playfair Display, Lora, Source Code Pro
- Inline SVG icons (Lucide-style)
- Data-driven architecture with separate `data.js` for all 100 items

## Project Structure

```
index.html          # Complete website (HTML + CSS + JS)

## Deployment

The site is a static single-page application. To deploy:

1. Host `index.html` and `data.js` in the same directory
2. Serve via GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting
3. Point your domain (e.g., `100.cemi.ai`) to the hosting

To test locally, just open `index.html` in a browser.
