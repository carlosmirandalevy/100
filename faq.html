                <div class="faq-chevron"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"></polyline></svg></div>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence &mdash; like understanding language, recognizing images, making decisions, and creating content. Modern AI models like ChatGPT and Claude are trained on vast amounts of text data, learning patterns in language to generate helpful, contextual responses. You interact with AI by typing natural language prompts, and it responds based on its training.</p>

                <h3>Do I need to know how to code to use AI?</h3>
                <div class="faq-chevron"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"></polyline></svg></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Not at all! Most AI tools are designed to be used through natural language &mdash; just type what you want in plain English (or French, Spanish, or any language). That said, learning basic concepts like Markdown and HTML (covered in our Toolkit section) can dramatically improve what you can create with AI. Think of it as learning a few magic words that unlock superpowers.</p>

                <h3>Is AI going to replace humans?</h3>
                <div class="faq-chevron"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"></polyline></svg></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>No &mdash; and that's the key message of this entire project. AI is not about replacing humans. It's about augmenting human capabilities. AI helps you do MORE, do BETTER, and learn NEW THINGS. The most powerful results come from humans and AI working together, each bringing their unique strengths.</p>

                <div class="faq-chevron"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"></polyline></svg></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>We recommend starting with Claude (claude.ai) or ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) for general text tasks &mdash; writing, learning, brainstorming, coding help. For image generation, try MidJourney or NanoBanana Pro (inside Google Gemini). For music, try Suno. Check our "Our Favorite Tools" page for the full list with descriptions.</p>

                <h3>Is it cheating to use AI for schoolwork?</h3>
                <div class="faq-chevron"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"></polyline></svg></div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>It depends on how you use it. Using AI to understand concepts better, get explanations, check your work, or brainstorm ideas is excellent learning. Copying AI output word-for-word without understanding it defeats the purpose. The key is to use AI as a learning partner, not a shortcut. Always check your school's AI policy and be transparent with your teachers.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Many AI tools offer free tiers that are surprisingly powerful. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and most tools on our list have free versions. Premium plans (typically $10-20/month) offer faster responses, more features, and higher limits. For students exploring AI, free tiers are more than enough to get started.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes! AI can and does make mistakes &mdash; this is called "hallucination." AI might present incorrect information confidently, make up facts, or give outdated answers. Always verify important information from AI, especially for academic work, health, legal, or financial topics. Think of AI as a very knowledgeable but sometimes unreliable friend.</p>
